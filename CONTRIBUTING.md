You can ask us at these communities:

 * [Ebiten Discord Server](https://discord.gg/3tVdM5H8cC)
 * `#ebiten` channel in [Gophers Slack](https://invite.slack.golangbridge.org/)
 * [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/hajimehoshi/ebiten/discussions)

## Following the Go convention

Please follow the Go convension like [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html).
For example, formatting by `go fmt` is required.

## Adding copyright comments to each file

You don't have to update existing files' license comments.

## Adding build tags for examples

```go
//go:build example
// +build example
```

`example` is to prevent from installing executions by `go get github.com/hajimehoshi/ebiten/v2/...`.

## Implementation details

Ebiten's documentations are managed at [ebiten/ebiten.org](https://github.com/ebiten/ebiten.org).  

Before submitting a documentation PR, read through the [README](https://github.com/ebiten/ebiten.org/blob/main/README.md) in that repo.
