# Contributing to Ebitengine

Ebitengine is an open source project and we appreciate your contributions!

There are some rules for Ebitengine contribution.

## Filing an issue in the GitHub issue

File an issue in the GitHub issues, if you find a problem or have a feature request but this is not filed.

Except for very trivial fixes like fixing misspelling, it is a must to have an issue.

## Asking us when you are not sure

In Ebitengine, problems might not be documented very well in GitHub issues. Please ask us before you work on such issue.

You can ask us at these communities:

 * [Ebitengine Discord Server](https://discord.gg/3tVdM5H8cC)
 * `#ebitengine` channel in [Gophers Slack](https://invite.slack.golangbridge.org/)
 * [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/hajimehoshi/ebiten/discussions)

## Following the Go convention

Please follow the Go convension like [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html).
For example, formatting by `go fmt` is required.
