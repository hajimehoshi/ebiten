There are some rules for Ebiten contribution.

## Ask us when you are not sure

You can ask us by [creating a GitHub issue](https://github.com/hajimehoshi/ebiten/issues/new) or at [Gophers Slack](https://invite.slack.golangbridge.org/)'s #ebiten channel.

## Follow the Go convention

Please follow the Go convension like [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html).
For example, formatting by `go fmt` is required.

## Add copyright comments to each file

You don't have to update existing files' license comments.

## Add build tags for examples

```go
// +build example jsgo
```

`example` is to prevent from installing executions by `go get github.com/hajimehoshi/ebiten/...`.

`jsgo` is to make the examples work on [jsgo.io](https://jsgo.io/).
